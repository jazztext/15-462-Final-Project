# 15-462-Final-Project
The final project for 15-462

Zach Shearer and Chris Kaffine (partner project)

Our goal is to be able to make high quality, efficient renderings of real-world physical simulations  with PDEs on meshes, by combining raytracing with mesh dynamics. Specifically, we'd like to be able to make realistic surface tensioning renderings.

1. We will speed up bvh construction with parallelism, as specified in option F.
2. We'll implement bidirectional pathtracing.
3. We'll implement surface tensioning based on the methods described in the CGL paper linked in the writeup.
4. We'll implement a few extra liquid materials, such as water.
5. Add some functionality to the GUI to allow the user to enter disturbances to the system...we might not do this.
